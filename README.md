gloam.io
==================

gloam.io is an interactive data visualization, that calculates—based on given latitudes—the sunrise, sunset and twilight times and creates a mesmerizing and stunning experience. [Try it out!](http://www.gloam.io)

Should work in every major browser and on a lot of smartphones. On iOS you have the best experience but Google Chrome renders the best.

The calculation happens over a PHP-script which is called by multiple AJAX requests.
